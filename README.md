# AnimeTracker
A side project aimed at trying out various Android architecure components, libraries and software design patterns. 
This project will also serve as an experiment for understanding Github Actions

## API
AnimeTracker uses Anlist's API: https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/

This API is GraphQL based so Apollo Android seemed like the ideal library to use:
